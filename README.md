Developed a CNN Model that can classify the type of fashion item/object that is present in the image (eg. shoes, purse, handbag,etc.) 
Used MNIST dataset for training and used talos libraries hyperparameter tuning to find the ideal design parameters for the CNN model 

The Talos library will perform hyperparameter tuning of your CNN and then can be used for your final CNN design.
